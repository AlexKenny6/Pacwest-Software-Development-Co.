        <h2>Lets start with the designing of a website!</h2>
        <p>We will begin to take notes of the things you would like on the webite. From there we will begin to sketch out a mock design and put it in Adobe XD. With the sketch, we can communicate on the next steps you would like to take.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>After the designing, we will begin to code (our favorite part).</h2>
        <p>An initial file will be in a programming language that we will use to create your project.</p>
        <p>Let's take a look at an example file:</p>
        <img src="img/html-php-coding.png" alt="Coding Picture">
        <br><br>
        <p>You can see in the file above that we break down each page into seperate files and at the end, we link everything up. In this picture, we used HTML5 and PHP to create the homepage for one of the websites we've developed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After development, we will upload the website using a service similar to CPanel and continue to update/monitor the project.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All websites will be on our dedicated server with AWS and will be monitored daily with weekly backups to keep everything safe!</p>

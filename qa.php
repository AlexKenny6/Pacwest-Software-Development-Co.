        <button class="accordion">How do you compare to companies that build a website like wix?</button>

            <p>
                Companies that build websites like wix are great for anyone starting out and wanting a super simple website. 
                Yet, once you begin to add more content and make it more customized, you will need to hire a designer/developer to create that customized and unique feeling for your website.
